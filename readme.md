# Demo Event Site

This is a very basic website for promoting an upcoming event. It's built using Flask and styled with TailwindCSS. The
site takes its content from the filesystem directly, but could easily be modified to include a basic CMS for authorized
users.

## Upgrades

In its current state it's intentionally basic, ideal for a one-off event. However, it could be enhanced in a number of
ways.

**Previous Events**

Add gallery of images from previous events in a separate section.

**CMS**

Add a CMS to allow authorized users to add or change existing content.

**RSVP**

Offer site owners the option to send unique invitation codes that can be used by guests to log in to a personalized
account and RSVP.
